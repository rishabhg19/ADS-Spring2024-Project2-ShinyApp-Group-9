### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

Term: Spring 2024

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app using one of **the OpenFEMA data sets** of your choice. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: We often hear the loud beeping noise of amber alerts signaling nearby flash flood warnings to be wary of, but these rarely have a direct impact on our lives. In this project, we take a closer look into when, where, why, and how much floods impact the establishments around us through looking at National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims. The NFIP is meant to protect establishments from flooding and future proof these establishments from expected flooding damage. This project explores NFIP claims and their relevance in assisting establishments in disproportionately affected areas.

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) Rishabh Ganesh organized and led meetings. Additionally, Rishabh Ganesh formulated business questions and determined the focus area for the project topic. Rishabh Ganesh also integrated data analysis and visualization into Shiny Server and wrote the Shiny UI. Rishabh Ganesh also maintained the repository and updated the README. Nicolette Auld-Griffith conducted the preliminary data analysis of the FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims dataset. Analysis included obersvations on annual trends, regional trends, structural impacts of flooding, and the causes of these disasters. Xiaoyu Mai deployed the Shiny App, revised code written by Nicolette, modified some code that generated charts to improve visualizations. Enhanced readability by implementing layout modifications, introducing section headings and removing warning messages. All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
