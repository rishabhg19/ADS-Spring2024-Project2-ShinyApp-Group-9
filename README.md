+ **Project summary**: We often hear the loud beeping noise of amber alerts signaling nearby flash flood warnings to be wary of, but these rarely have a direct impact on our lives. In this project, we take a closer look into how these floods impact the establishments around us, and how we protect the establishments from  future flooding damage. The goal of this project is to learn about how flood insurance policies help businesses and other establishments, and whether flood insurance policies are adequate in disproportionately affected areas.

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) Nicolette Auld-Griffith conducted the preliminary data analysis of the FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims dataset. Analysis included obersvations on annual trends, regional trends, structural impacts of flooding, and the causes of these disasters. All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
